# SpotifyDeepSearch
Add-on created on top of Spotipy to search similar artists. Recursive depth and width can also be specified to give a larger network of artists.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need to install **Spotipy** package for Python which can be found **[here](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/2.12.0/#installation)** to make use of Spotify's API. Future builds will remove this dependency on Spotipy.

You will also need **Pandas** as artist data are stored in pandas.DataFrames and are then saved as .csv files.

### Installing
```
pip install spotipy
pip install pandas
```
You could also use-
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### What it does-
